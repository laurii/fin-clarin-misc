First set either of the following:

COURT="kho"
COURT="kko"

For a fresh start run first in directory '/data/eaxelson/$COURT/sf-data/orig/$COURT':

  rm -fR data pkgs registry vrt && mkdir registry

Run then in the same directory:

  ./court-generate-all-vrt-files.sh --${COURT} --fin
  ./court-generate-all-vrt-files.sh --${COURT} --swe

and then:

  ./court-generate-all-corpora.sh --${COURT} --fin [--separate-years]
  ./court-generate-all-corpora.sh --${COURT} --swe [--separate-years]

Finally copy generated corpora under '/usr/lib/cgi-bin/corpora':

  sudo cp registry/* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/corpora/registry/
  sudo cp -R data/* /usr/lib/cgi-bin/corpora/data/



Note: the following files in directory kko/fi have been modified as they had
some typos in date tags:

kko19890070.xml kko19960153.xml kko20000102.xml kko20010103.xml kko20040110.xml

and the following files in directory kko/sv:

kko19800113t.xml kko19810091t.xml kko19900121.xml kko19910186.xml
kko19960153.xml kko20020093.xml kko20020094.xml kko20020095.xml
kko20020096.xml kko20020097.xml kko20030058.xml kko20040110.xml

and the file in directory kho/fi:

kho201301846.xml

There exists a corresponding original file *.xml.original for each
of the files. Some Swedish files do not have a date given,
so 0101(YEAR) is set as date for them by the processing tools.


Note: the following files in directory kko/fi have been renamed to *.xml.swedish
as they contain only Swedish and the same text is already under directory kko/sv:

kko19800021t.xml kko19800032t.xml kko19800093t.xml kko19810017t.xml
kko19810028t.xml kko19810053t.xml kko19810085t.xml kko19820056t.xml
kko19820062t.xml kko19820095t.xml kko19820117t.xml kko19820183t.xml
kko19830103t.xml kko19830111t.xml kko19830121t.xml kko19830148t.xml

kko19870039.xml kko19870040.xml kko19870061.xml


Note: some of the files in directory kko/fi contain some Swedish text that
e.g. refers to court decisions given in Swedish (in Finland or Sweden).
